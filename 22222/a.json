It is in this context that the story of 'The Lawsuit' is told. The main character, Vivian Amsalem, has proposed marriage since three years ago, but her husband, Eliza, does not agree. Even though Elisha is hard_headed and refuses to compromise, Viviane is determined to fight for her freedom, but the attitude of the religious ruler is ambiguous. In the course of the three_way tug_of_war, a scene of tragedy and absurdity continues to unfold.",

				"brief_introduction": "12.Far from Anatolia in Istanbul, retired theater actor Aidan (Haluk Bilginer) has embarked on a new life as a columnist. He writes about religion day in and day out with a pretense of concern, absorbed in the seemingly profound world of thought he has created for himself. Aydin runs a hotel on his pension and has a number of properties for rent, which makes him seem hypocritical and cold in his contact with the general public. His sister Nika (Demet Akbag), divorced at an early age, often huddles in Aidan's study, arguing about his writing and even taunting each other. His wife Nihal (Melisa S√∂zen) is young and independent, with a passion for various charity work. The old couple, who live apart and have very different attitudes, drift apart and a rift appears in their relationship ......",

					"comment_on": "The 3 hours and 16 minutes are set in the alien planet_like landscape of Cappadocia, with a large amount of dialogue rarely seen in Ceylonese cinema, to unravel the dilemma of human communication getting deeper and more distant. All the characters in the play have done nothing wrong, and are even good people in their own world, but there are always violent and incomprehensible conflicts brewing and erupting behind their contradictory interests and behavioral logic. Many times the virtue of humility and concessions will only make the other side in the quarrel as a provocation."

					"comment_on": "This is a pessimistic film to the core, the gap between different social classes can not be eliminated, dear between you and me but there is an impenetrable barrier, every attempt to communicate eventually become mutual harm. Only hibernation, perhaps the world can be returned to the quiet, or, in all walks of life, no longer use words, but simply listen to the communication of the heart. The conversation becomes a piece, but wonderful, class, human nature, through the painful chat or quarrel presented."
