A small court, a simple divorce proceeding, but round and round becomes a knot that can never be untied, this is the imbalance of gender relations in Jewish marriage, the unequal status of women led to women's rights are completely ignored, too oppressive.
1.2     2016-01-05 01:12:00 5分
A simple divorce proceeding lasted five years, and the confrontation in a single scene was very tense, and the long trial revealed the absurdity of the male-dominated social environment and the religious court system. The most rare thing is that the director did not set the female protagonist as a traditional underdog image, from the costume to the way she acts, she is rebellious, self-directed and self-acting is also worthy of recognition.
1.3   2015-11-24 08:58:18  4分
Minimal scenes, minimal plot, but tells a story with extremely rich connotations, religion, society, emotions, human nature, and more importantly, the status and fate of a woman in that kind of environment, captivating the audience. Surprise, anger, reflection, and a touch of celebration ......

The middle section of the accordion competition is wonderful, accordion accompanied by singers singing two by two, the lyrics are improvised, there is a mood and rhyme. A bunch of South American peasants, looks rough and old bark, but the music is warm, deep and exquisite. The image of the South American wandering singer, by translating the text and then imagining it, is not reliable after all. Go see the movie, the scenery and music are there. Know Spanish better. =3=
2.2        2010-10-07 22:21:25 5分
A poetic movie with great lines, beautiful scenery and great music!

Interesting Swedish film, the present line is a typical black comedy, the memory line is a bit of Forrest Gump, so that the virtual characters cleverly become a number of history of the first person.
3.3        2016-02-18 20:26:01 5分
Forrest Gump + Bean-style comedy. Quite interesting, it is said to have deleted a lot especially the Chinese part. So good to see the original.

The ending doesn't matter, and the details don't have to matter. Love, courage and virtue are priceless; money, status and fame are like grass. You should believe that this story is true, because it is worth believing.

Haley Joel Osment~Eric Balfour  final appearance. Very funny, they 3 people to go fishing, one with How To Fish, the other with a gun rushing the water fish on the fight, and then the little boy with the fish basket catch ~ so happy! Just dreaming of lions and tigers at night ~ ugh!

The magnificent blue skies of Texas, the endless countryside, two eccentric nature of the uncle, a sad little boy, plus a dying lion ...... This is a film about growing up. A long-lost sense of fairy tales, smiles like lotus flowers. Very much like the two old guys in the scene, once reigning in the field, fierce appearance, hidden under the cute, stubborn, kind, loyal, brave ......

"Although the world is big, there is love around the corner!" In a specific historical context, the whole film revolves around "chess" and "riding", backgammon and dice are the perfect objects to maintain the relationship between grandfather, father and son, and the props to change the current situation of the family's survival; while the tandem bicycle is the bridge between grandfather and his amnesiac The tandem bicycle is the bridge between the grandfather and his amnesiac grandson, and the vehicle for the director to capture the beautiful scenery of the Bulgarian highway for the audience. The camera finally rewinds, but life still moves forward.

Everyone is eager to live a better life and have a better life. And this road, winding, thorny, resistance, let people hope at the same time let people lose, repeatedly, full of magic, let people fascinated.
6.2       2012-02-01 22:10:01 5分
The hanging heart is finally put down with the ending that foretells a better future. I like this real movie, no fancy, the rhythm of the warm and cold between father and son is also very well grasped, not dragging at all, Demian's performance is very impressive, from the calm and simple villagers of the town to the father's responsibility and affection are shown to the fullest. Thanks to the Screen Actors Guild for not being a relic of 2011.
6.3        2012-02-24 12:16:59  5分
It makes people move. Seeing the glimmer of hope and subsequently falling deeper into trouble, again and again, but not giving up hope.

Never disappointing Turkish film, as if immersive in the countryside, music permeates every plot, all about growing up, love teacher, father hatred, voyeurism, lack of love is almost every person growing up are more or less experienced stories. Whether the poster, costumes, soundtrack, photography, plot, ending, etc. are not to be missed good movies. The key is that there is also a small positive like Eva Green.
7.2  2013-09-09 10:46:44 4分
Literary and lyrical Turkish idyllic film, night, noon and dawn foreshadow the children's mutated psychological state, young girls and boys each pregnant and teenage rebellious psychological dark side, déjà vu growing pains, poetic soundtrack and beautiful photography as if to show a ritual about growing up.
7.3  2016-04-08 21:08:20 5分
The light frozen in the stillness, the afternoon reverie of embracing nature and being close to the land, taking prayer time as the cut-off point, capturing the fragments of teenagers gradually touching and feeling the real life; the morning and evening of the week, the flickering of light spots on the wall, the alternation of new life and death, the interplay of rebellion and growth, the youthful teenagers with crushes, the crying girls on the moonlit night, everyone has such a particularly torturous time of cocoon breaking on their way.

I'm turning into a die-hard fan. Props on the use of whimsical not to mention. Those real fall ah plant ah roll ah hit ah ... It is said that in order to shoot the film not only broken foot bones, but also broken neck bone, and I was oblivious to continue to shoot, only to find a year and a half after the fracture recovery left traces, in his words is: feel the head has been hurting ...... aliens, right?
8.2   2016-01-22 01:41:53 5分
Cubism simple housing + pick up soap to break the fourth wall, and the action scenes are still so desperate, simply bully bomb.
8.3  2018-11-27 10:19:27 5分
1. overwhelming, exquisite shots, let people open their eyes, admire to the bottom of the heart; 2. classic feet across two cars, post-modern shape full of "organs" of the house, fence seconds into bamboo ladders, shocking carousel house (here the lens, editing is too powerful), very realistic "3. directly with the hand to block the camera, can be so pioneering avant-garde experiments, too interesting; 4. still interesting Buster Keaton, charming heroine.

Director Dudley has a soft heart, he let the most humble people still retain the hope of dreaming. In fact, I would rather watch a movie like this than "City of God" ah! The young actors acted so well~
9.2   2015-03-31 21:17:38 4分
Perhaps there are a few hard details, but the way the story is told flows smoothly, and the editing and soundtrack serve the exciting development of the story. The opening is fascinating, and then the story unfolds, so that people can not stop.

There are no superior white people, no stupid and pedantic Africans, and no arrogance and self-centeredness of the Western colonial culture, but rather a true representation of the helplessness of white Westerners in a foreign land and the simple and cheerful nature of Africans. Yes, this is not the ideal life, this is the real life needed.

The Germans are always good at infiltrating the history of their country into the film industry, and all three Oscar-winning works are linked to history. From the point of view of the script is nothing but the transformation of people's character under extreme circumstances, but the only character unchanged the design of the role of the daughter to make the plot more smooth and harmonious; unchanged war story but also because of the background to Kenya, Africa and change. The ending shot is very poetic and I love the innocent little actress.


11.1             2013-06-25 15:16:08 5分
The first of the ten best of the year was born, the climax from the beginning of the film to the end of the last moment, the novel's open-ended ending was changed into a divine Möbius ring, unlike the original author's strong nationalistic plot, the director sought to make this story seek to communicate the feeling, but also than the original work to 'clean'. The only place where you can tell the director is Mira Nair is the extensive use of music, with an unusually strong world style.
11.2                 2013-11-19 11:56:49 5分
The Venice opening film, a great adaptation of a novel, is directed by a wonderful woman with some similar experiences to the hero. The film is not fundamentalist, but offers an alternative perspective on terrorism, with a Pakistani who has been part of the American upper class, and a number of Americans he comes into contact with, illustrating the interesting ambiguity of the "camp" orientation, where trust is never reached and the world is not black and white. A murderous dialogue runs throughout.
11.3                 2014-03-16 18:00:03  5分
Mira Nair's work. The beginning of the book is rather uninformative, but when you take a moment to read it, it's great, fast-paced and almost word for word. Kate Hudson has dyed her hair maroon and is almost unrecognizable.

Not as dull as expected, the lines still have a lot of content, plus the usual excellent photography in Ceylon. The choice of scenery on the unique, exterior scenes seem very spectacle
12.2           2014-05-20 04:55:32 5分
The 3 hours and 16 minutes are set in the alien planet-like landscape of Cappadocia, with a large amount of dialogue rarely seen in Ceylonese cinema, to unravel the dilemma of human communication getting deeper and more distant. All the characters in the play have done nothing wrong, and are even good people in their own world, but there are always violent and incomprehensible conflicts brewing and erupting behind their contradictory interests and behavioral logic. Many times the virtue of humility and concessions will only make the other side in the quarrel as a provocation.
12.3                 2014-12-22 16:29:55 5分
This is a pessimistic film to the core, the gap between different social classes can not be eliminated, dear between you and me but there is an impenetrable barrier, every attempt to communicate eventually become mutual harm. Only hibernation, perhaps the world can be returned to the quiet, or, in all walks of life, no longer use words, but simply listen to the communication of the heart. The conversation becomes a piece, but wonderful, class, human nature, through the painful chat or quarrel presented.

I will not watch it a second time anyway. The process of watching the film is painful. The cruelty of the real case is far beyond the story. The punishment of the mindless collective.

This is what kind of a mother, first at the expense of other people's children to protect their own children, and then at the expense of their own children to protect themselves, it's been a long time since I've hated a character in a movie with such gritted teeth, and every minute of watching this movie is torture.
13.3         2015-02-24 18:54:20  5分
"I can't judge." Human nature is so complex that it's impossible to judge good or bad. I always feel that the EP scenes are very small is it my mistake? The tragedy at the end of the film is a bit of "The Lovely Bones", with the same post-mortem visual narrative of what happened in the future. "Sacrifice other people's children to protect their own children, and then sacrifice their own children to protect themselves".

The acting is so perfect! "People are capable of taking the power of life and death into their own hands, and the autonomy to decide on life and death is the most basic right that human beings have." While euthanasia is a relief for some people, it may leave many more without the courage to live.
14.3   2010-05-29 01:36:57 5分
This is the first time I bought for the American melodrama, the story is a little too ambitious, but to now are so controversial issues can be performed without showing excessive bias is really not easy. The first shot of Pacino scared me, the performance is so precise that there is nothing to say, and the long shot of the court giving up self-defense simply makes people's hair stand on end. I want to take a bow for him, and by the way, teach him to play this stubborn old man some legal fur.

The Wandering Artist Act does not talk about love, "love, ideal" are empty concepts, only "need", "he needs me", although there are so many opportunities to escape, she still chose to Stay, unless abandoned. Despite his rudeness, brutality, all kinds of bad, but the first time the big money when the two went to the restaurant, he first asked what she wanted to eat, every time the meal, but also to her with a large bowl. Only details and life, no love.
15.3   2011-07-31 17:33:08  5分
It's the kind of ending that will leave you longing and teary-eyed. There will be many people who want to shoot a similar story, want to shoot a happy ending, to fill the black hole it creates in the heart, but in the end, you will still feel this painful ending is so beautiful, so impossible to let go. You will think of those lost, fleeting, within reach, but still hanging in the distance of the beautiful dream.

The simple bond between grandfather and grandson has become the most touching sentiment of "Letters from Heaven". The movie not only uses the perspective of the mother returning from overseas to cleverly create the tension of the plot and the education of the children to focus on the issue, but also uses life and death to render the pain of parting from the affection.
16.2   2012-01-18 14:03:27  5分
The child is the cute point, the grandfather is the tear point; several times choking can not hold back, the tears fly to make a pouring rain.
16.3  2022-12-23 13:30:03  5分
Very moving indeed, the love of grandchildren, the unbreakable bond. The role of the mother is spot on, like most mothers nowadays, a bit impatient, but still not lost. The old man is steady and steady, embodying kindness, and kindness to the fullest. The morning is really great, the child's naughtiness and innocence, and that resourcefulness.

Good movies, whether it's a romance action film， costume film， drama film they have in common is the ability to truly express a certain or certain aspects of human nature whether it's good, evil, joy or anger, so that when you watch the movie does not feel like watching a movie but watching yourself.

One of the best war films I've ever seen, a rare work of small vision, a tear-jerker depicting the tragedy and comedy of ordinary people caught up in the absurdity and ruthlessness of war. The five Oscar nominees for Best Foreign Language Film have seen three so far: Leviathan, Sister Ada and Kumquat, and this film is the most surprising!
19.2     2016-10-26 18:01:42  5分
Calm and restrained, yet not without tension. The bickering between the two rivals in the house even adds a bit of humor. From the beginning of the film, it seems that there are arrows on the string, but the development is not rushed, just like the calmness of the orange grove. I kept thinking about the yellow tape, and at the end, with the big vision of the Estonian village, the Georgian music sings slowly, I like it too much. #♪ To death ♪
19.3    2016-03-18 21:41:25 5分
Two soldiers of rival nations, two ordinary farmers, the wounds of war, the glory of humanity, a simple anti-war film, the script always feels like it was read a long time ago, the rhythm is simple and fast, steady, the actors are great, the scenery and photography is also good, the end of the tape that music is great!

Watching me a snotty nose and a tear... Finally, Choi Dongwon did not know that the end of the game is simply a godsend. I don't think the sensationalism is excessive, but real and lovely. Even the sadness and happiness of small people are moving. Also, who would have thought that Cho Seung-woo Cho Jin-woo actually met in this movie... and who would have thought that Signal and Secret Sam are now being compared to each other...
20.2    2017-08-20 21:32:18  4分
The second half of the film was a bloodbath, and although the end was deliberately melodramatic, it was still a willingness to be set up and to be impressed by the sportsmanship of not compromising and not giving up. Cao actor is worthy of the existence of the so-called "thousand faces", a change of role is like a different person, completely different temperament, admire!
20.3     2017-08-06 01:19:42 5分
The duel was exciting and heart-wrenching. Cho Seung Woo never disappoints in his role, and he performs it very well. When he saw Choi Dong Won's shoulder bruises, he had tears in his eyes, and his sportsmanship and strong character were touching.

Faith and love open us to the touch of life, the great love that can give infinite power to all things, to every small human being.
21.3        2015-07-08 05:53:44 4分
I wouldn't say this is a religious movie; it adapts a more atheist approach to view religions, and in the end the point being stressed is that faith is deeply connected with the hope for humanity.

As a war-torn country straddling Europe and Asia, it is a difficult choice to look forward and backward. It's hard to give up the humanistic feelings of the homeland while yearning for a stable and beautiful new life, it's really a taste of the old country that you can't look back on, but the sick trees still have a warm spring.

It was always a serious film to watch, although the old man also folded paper boats, the professor to tear the paper is laughable, but until the woman called to say that today's snow, tomorrow will become sludge, only to realize how ridiculous, ridiculous and unnecessary their discussion about whether the revolution has happened. The 48-minute long shot at the end was awesome.
23.2  2022-02-14 14:54:25 4分
A live TV discussion to return to the historical scene, all kinds of overthrow, threats and insistence on having seen. Whether or not the revolution took place in this part of the world, whether or not he participated, it seems to have become an unanswered question. It seems that there are no answers, but the film uses some people to come up with a lot of questions worth thinking about. For example, the Chinese say that the Romanians themselves infighting problem, in fact, when very good intentioned tips, he thinks that people should not hold on to other people's pigtails, and this is not the reason to deny others. The textile factory is now the decision maker of the TV station's discourse, and the former employee of the security bureau indicated in the call that he was the factory manager, issuing a series of threats, which looks like a direct irony of class differences really pulled full circle. The mutual illumination of the cycle of the extinguishing of street lights at the end of the opening and the end again seems like a fatalistic dovetailing of history and the present.
23.3    2010-01-09 06:29:35  5分
"All history is contemporary history." A slightly good-natured sneer at historical narrators. Plain shots, no rush, no slow pace. It's a shame that the pacing is a little worse at the end. But it's still a five-star masterpiece.

24.2    2011-06-01 15:23:01  5分
The film is nested in the film (history), and resonates with the love story of the main characters under the weaving of a multi-dimensional narrative. Those "kisses" left in time, engraved on the film and hidden in the beautiful dream, left for the audience to decode consciously, open up the pulse of the film. The recent history of mankind is thus linked with a love story and the history of cinema. The film's original soundtrack, like a guide, leads the audience through the emotional ups and downs with ease.
24.3   2011-09-07 01:16:51  5分
Franchement,vous êtes encore capable d'aimer quelqu'un. Really, you are still able to love . How can you know love without knowing life. The story is very emotional! The story is really exciting and wonderful!

The film is so cold that it is even a bit eerie. Washing the soul is also deadly lonely
25.2   2012-12-16 16:41:13  5分
A very praiseworthy point is that this does not use the trick of sensationalism at all. The plot is simple and the dialogue is maybe one or two hundred lines in total. Death is a terrible subject, the film does not make it less terrible, but also not the slightest retreat from death. I saw it at Icelandic Cinema Online for 3 euros.
25.3  2015-09-03 23:38:33 5分
The surreal lens in the film brings the color of mysticism, this mystery is also a variety of migration and return to the laws of nature. The line will be dead, might as well use flesh and blood to feel the beautiful homeland, might as well die in the past fond memories. The film also mentions the pain of war, which is also worth reflecting on.
