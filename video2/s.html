    <h1>Thoughts</h1>
    <p>"This is a collection of love letters from different generations Serena uses a lot of different typography to make the site very interesting and clear at the same time. I really like the font she chose, it's very fitting for the subject."</p>
    <p>“The overall site is very unique and I enjoyed viewing the site. I found navigation to be very clear and concise. It is a very complete piece.”</p>
